## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**textPrompts** | [**List<TextPrompt>**](TextPrompt.md) | An array of text prompts to use for generation.  Due to how arrays are represented in `multipart/form-data` requests, prompts must adhere to the format `text_prompts[index][text|weight]`, where `index` is some integer used to tie the text and weight together.  While `index` does not have to be sequential, duplicate entries  will override previous entries, so it is recommended to use sequential indices.  Given a text prompt with the text `A lighthouse on a cliff` and a weight of `0.5`, it would be represented as: ``` text_prompts[0][text]: \"A lighthouse on a cliff\" text_prompts[0][weight]: 0.5 ```  To add another prompt to that request simply provide the values under a new `index`:  ``` text_prompts[0][text]: \"A lighthouse on a cliff\" text_prompts[0][weight]: 0.5 text_prompts[1][text]: \"land, ground, dirt, grass\" text_prompts[1][weight]: -0.9 ``` | [default to const []]
**initImage** | [**MultipartFile**](MultipartFile.md) | Image used to initialize the diffusion process, in lieu of random noise. | 
**initImageMode** | [**InitImageMode**](InitImageMode.md) |  | [optional] 
**stepScheduleStart** | **num** | Skips a proportion of the start of the diffusion steps, allowing the init_image to influence the final generated image.  Lower values will result in more influence from the init_image, while higher values will result in more influence from the diffusion steps.  (e.g. a value of `0` would simply return you the init_image, where a value of `1` would return you a completely different image.) | [optional] [default to 0.65]
**stepScheduleEnd** | **num** | Skips a proportion of the end of the diffusion steps, allowing the init_image to influence the final generated image.  Lower values will result in more influence from the init_image, while higher values will result in more influence from the diffusion steps. | [optional]
