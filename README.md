[![Build Status](https://github.com/shamblett/stabilityai_client/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/shamblett/stabilityai_client/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A [Stability.ai ](https://stability.ai/)REST client for Dart.

This package provides both a server and browser based client for the [Stabilty.ai
REST API](https://platform.stability.ai/rest-api) to allow the creation and manipulation of images from text prompts, 
the listing of engine information and account and balance details.

The bindings for the API are generated from the [Stabilty.ai OpenApi specification](lib/src/openapi/spec/openapi.json) 
using the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project.
The client itself is a thin wrapper around this code.

API documentation generated by the OpenAPI Generator can be found [here](lib/src/openapi/doc).

See the [examples.md](example/example.md) document in the examples folder for usage examples.

Currently V1 of the interface is implemented, this will be updated as 
other versions of the API are released.

A Stability.ai API key is needed for authentication, see [How to find your API key](https://platform.stability.ai/docs/getting-started/authentication)
to set this up.
